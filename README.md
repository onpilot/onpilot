# Hi, I'm Idan 👋
_[Frontend developer / Ex web designer / React.js enthusiast]_

`I create something with ⚡ JavaScript + 🧁 CSS.`

Prior to software engineering,  I found myself to be a self-taught designer. I was freelancing as a finished artist and, over the course, begin designing for product labels and websites back then. That's why as a developer, I tend to love carefully designed websites and apps more.

- 🚀 I’m currently building [my github page](http://onpilot.github.io/).
- 👨‍🚀 I’m passionate about web development.
- 🔭 Currently learning a11y and ci/cd.
- ✨ Fun fact: I already like you ❤️.
