# Hi, I'm Idan 👋
_[Frontend developer / Ex web designer / React.js enthusiast]_

`I create something with ⚡ JavaScript + 🧁 CSS.`

Prior to software engineering,  I found myself to be a self-taught designer. I was freelancing as a finished artist and, over the course, designing for product labels, websites and apps. That's why as a developer, I tend to love carefully designed websites and apps more.

- 🚀 I’m currently building [my github page](http://onpilot.github.io/).
- 👨‍🚀 I’m passionate to collaborate on open source projects.
- 🧝‍♀️ All UX developers and designers are my friends.
- 🍵 Sometimes, I kinda like learning about machine learning and natural language processing. 
- ✨ Fun fact: I already like you ❤️.

You can find me on Twitter [@onpilot_](https://twitter.com/onpilot_) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/onpilot). I don't byte.
