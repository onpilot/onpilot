### About
I'm a junior software developer, made a Promise ✍️ in JavaScript and currently learning to ⚛️ React.

I came from a small town 🏡, somewhere in Java island, and moved to a major city 🌇 to get lucky. Like the legend of the Phoenix 🐤🔥, huh. _*ps: I'm not associated with Daft Punk_ 🤖. _Please don't tell it to them_.

Prior to software engineering,  I found myself to be a self-taught designer. I was freelancing as a finished artist 🧑‍🎨 and over the course designing for product labels, websites and apps. That's why as a software developer, I tend to love well-designed apps and website more.

- 🚀 I’m currently building [my github page](http://onpilot.github.io/), still in progress.
- 👨‍🚀 I’m passionate to collaborate on open source projects.
- 🧙 All UX developers are my friends.
- 🍵 In my spare time, I like learning about machine learning and natural language processing. 
- ✨ Fun fact: I already like you ❤️.

You can find me on Twitter [@onpilot_](https://twitter.com/onpilot_) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/onpilot). I don't byte.
